# GitHub Repository
This is a GitHub repository for a mathematical model solved with Cplex solver. 
First, you should download the project.
The project contains input data for the model, the implemented model and also the configuration file with default setting. 
The input data includes information about a workflow and resources of cloud prividers.  
The out put of the project is the value of decision variables which will be identified after solving the model. 
The output identifies the optimal assignment of tasks to resources.
